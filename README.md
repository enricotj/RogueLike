# RogueLike

A top-down shooter/slicer Rogue Like game inspired by Hyper Light Drifter and Risk of Rain.

Proposed Controls:
WASD to move (working)
Mouse to Aim (working)
(Shift+)Left/Right Click for Four Abilities (Shoot <WIP>, Sword, Dash, Item)

TODO:
 - Basic Enemy AI (Random Wandering, Direct Chase/Aim/Shoot)
 - Player Bullet Interactions with Enemies
 - Enemy Bullet Interactions with Terrain
 - Enemy Bullet Interactions with Player
 - Combine multiple level tiles into mesh chunks for game object optimization (currently not an issue)
